What is GIT - version control tool/system
Why do we need it - tracks our code & allows to work together

How to move code to the github
(git workflow)

1. Identify files/code inside which folder you need
2. initialize a git repository which will be empty
		(happens only once)
	git init
3. add files to the stage 
	git add . (add everything)

4. commit files with the message to local repository

	git commit -m "";

5. git status check difference/status of files between local repo and working directory

6. Once changes are commited to the local repo then we can push them to the remote (GitHub)

7. If it is first time we need to create a connection 
	git remote add origin URL to your repo
	(we do it only once)

8. Then we need to make sure we point to the master/main branch

	git branch -M man

9. now we are ready to push the code
	git push -u origin main
